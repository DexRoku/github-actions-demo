# This is a GitHub Actions workflow file that generates ASCII art, executes a shell script,
# and runs a Python script to display ASCII art. It consists of three jobs: build_job_1, test_job_2, and deploy_job_3.
# The idea is to use different jobs stages to demonstrate how to generate ASCII art in various ways,
# including using a shell script and a Python script. The workflow also includes steps to check for file existence,
# upload and download artifacts, and perform basic debugging tasks.

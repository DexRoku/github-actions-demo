# GitHub Actions Project

This repository is a simple project to learn and experiment with **GitHub Actions** — GitHub's built-in CI/CD automation tool.

## 🚀 Purpose

The goal of this project is to:

* Understand how GitHub Actions work
* Create and run workflows on push, pull requests, or other events
* Learn basic CI concepts like jobs, steps, actions, and environment variables

## 📁 Repository Structure

```
.
├── .github
│   └── workflows
│       └── main.yml      # Example GitHub Actions workflow file
├── src/                  # Sample source code (if any)
├── README.md             # This file
└── ...
```

## ⚙️ What This Workflow Does

The example workflow (`main.yml`) currently does the following:

* Triggers on every push to the `main` branch
* Checks out the repository code
* Runs a basic script (e.g., `echo Hello World`, or other commands)

You can find it here: [.github/workflows/main.yml](.github/workflows/main.yml)

## ✅ How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/github-actions-demo.git
   cd github-actions-demo
   ```

2. Make changes and push them to GitHub.

3. Go to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repo to see the workflow run.
